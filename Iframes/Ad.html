Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls

Now and then, she tried to run
And then on a night with the setting sun
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone

They warned her, don't go there
There's creatures who are hidin' in the dark

Then somethin' came creepin'
It told her, "Don't you worry, " just

Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh


She knew she was hypnotized
And walking on cold, thin ice
Then it broke, and she awoke again

Then she ran faster and
Start screamin', "Is there someone out there?
Please help me, come get me"
Behind her, she can hear it say

Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh

Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreamin' of
Just let me in, ooh
Then she ran faster and
Start screamin', "Is there someone out there?
Please help me"
Just let me in, ooh
